      <h2>Bezier Curves, Polynomials and Gradient Descent</h2>
      <p>
        This demo uses machine learning to find the "control points" of a Bezier Curve (in your Chromium Browser).  
        The curve on the left is described by the rainbow colored control points.  Modulate them, then click Train.
        Given the curve, this module uses gradient descent to find those same control points (loss=.0001). 
        <b>This will take 30 seconds or more, depending on your computer. A window alert will let you know it's done.</b>

      <h2>For Hire</h2>
      <p>
        I am a full stack developer and generalist programmer (and U.S. Citizen).  My primary domains are web interfaces, networks, data I/O, crypto, and ML/AI. I have 7 years experience with Node.js, JavaScript, CSS, DOM &amp Web APIs, etc;  2 years active ML engineering and development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote the ML framework this modules uses (on top of TensorFlow.js).  I wrote the Node.js front-end bundler.  The Bezier Curve interface is another front-end module I developed for playing with high-performance algorithms, such as live audio/video; it has <a href="http://nhq.github.io/parametrical/public"> several useful components</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can hire me for consultation in ML, or development of any kind.  Salary or contract.  Relocation maybe; remote okayâ€”I'm on the West Coast.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have big ideas about AI and Machine Learning.  I would like most to work on those, potentially in robotics, biology, chemistry, or AGI (I Want To Believe).  If you are enterprising and risk taking, let's talk!
