      <h2>Bezier Curves, Polynomials and Gradient Descent</h2>
      <p>
        This is a demonstration using modern machine learning to find the "control points" of a Bezier Curve.  
        </p>
        <p>
        The curve on the left is described by the rainbow colored control points.
        </p>
        <p>
        Given the resutling curve, this module uses gradient descent to find those same control points.
        It could solve for fewer or more control points, as many as needed to fit the curve.
        It could also solve for more than the two dimensions of a typical bezier curve.

      <h2>For Hire</h2>
      <p>
        This is a demonstration of skill in my primary domains: interfaces, full stack development, and ML/AI R&D.
      </p>
      <p>
        
        I wrote the ML framework (on top of TensorFlow.js).  I wrote the Node.js front-end bundler.  The bezier curve interface is separate front-end module I developed for playing with high-performance algorithms, such as for live audio/video, and has several useful components.
